# Nutri Track
## A simple diet tracker which helps keep track of nutrients, along with providing health tips

This project is based on the Flask framework, which utilizes a webpage to allow logging into or registering as a new user in order to keep track of different health parameters. The project also calculates certain stats based on inputs, which may provide more insight on health decisions.
